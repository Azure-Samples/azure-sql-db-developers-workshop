## Using Azure SQL Database and Visual Studio Code

This workshop will use SQL Server 2022 and the Azure SQL Database for the backends. We can create a full instance of SQL Server 2022 locally with docker for free as well as create a free Azure SQL Database in the Azure Cloud; we will use both and seamlessly deploy our database objects with Database Projects from our local docker instance to the cloud.

The SQL Database gives us the ability to store data not only in the traditional relational database format (tables/rows/columns), but also in JSON as well as graph relationships. This flexibility of data storage and deployment options, all while being free to use gives developers a compelling option for their backend database. Azure SQL Database goes beyond a basic cloud database by being a modern, fully managed platform as a service (PaaS) that handles database management functions such as upgrading, patching, backups, and monitoring without developer involvement.

### SQL Database Projects and CI/CD

The SQL Database Projects extension is an Azure Data Studio and Visual Studio Code extension for developing SQL databases in a project-based development environment that sets you up for full CI/CD workflows. These database projects can be deployed into a new database creating development/test environments or in existing databases applying only the changes found in a particular deployment version or branch. Combine SQL Database Projects with GitHub actions to create a CI/CD flow for testing changes and correcting issues before they get into production environments by applying the changes to a database upon every commit or pull request.

## Database Workshop Tasks

### Create a SQL Database Project

    Create free Azure SQL Database/create local DB on docker
    Log into the database with Azure Data Studio/VS Code/Code spaces
    Create and use SQL/Database Projects
    Create application tables (table designer?) in SQL Project
    Data Types
    Primary Keys/ID columns
    Default Values
    Foreign Keys
    Deploy objects to database via SQL Projects Publish
    Database Security tasks
    Create application users
    Apply roles/Grants to application users 

1. Source the .bashrc file to uptake the changes in the codespace

    ```bash
    . ~/.bashrc
    ```

1. Start at a command terminal and create the project directory

    ```bash
    mkdir database
    ```

1. Enter the directory

    ```bash
    cd database
    ```

1. And create a Database Project using a new templates via .NET

    ```bash
    dotnet new sqlproj -n "devDB" -tp "SqlAzureV12"
    ```

1. Use the side extensions panel in VS Code and select **SQL Database Projects**

    ![A picture of the side extensions panel in VS Code with SQL Database Projects highlighted](./media/ch2/database1.png)

    If your project is not automatically opened in the Database Projects extension, you can find it by clicking the Open existing green button

    ![A picture of clicking the Open existing green button](./media/ch2/database2.png)

    and then selecting the devDB.sqlproj file located at /workspaces/azure-sql-db-developers-workshop/database/devDB/ using the find file modal.

    ![A picture of selecting the devDB.sqlproj file located at /workspaces/codespace-for-DB-Devs/database/devDB/](./media/ch2/database3.png)

1. Next, create a database locally with go-sqlcmd and Docker. This command will download the image from the Microsoft container repository and create a full SQL Server 2022 instance (Developer Edition) on your local machine or in the code space.

    ```bash
    sqlcmd create mssql -u devDB --accept-eula
    ```
    ![A picture of creating a database with sqlcmd](./media/ch2/database4.png)


1. Using sqlcmd, view the connection string information with the following sqlcmd command

    ```bash
    sqlcmd config connection-strings
    ```

    ![A picture of getting the database connection information with sqlcmd](./media/ch2/database5.png)

    Take note of the user (vscode) and the password that follows.

1. Using the extensions panel, select the SQL Server connections extension 

    ![A picture of selecting the SQL Server connection extension in code spaces](./media/ch2/database6.png)

    and create a new connection by clicking either the Add Connection label or the plus sign on the upper right in the extension.

    ![A picture of creating a new connection by clicking either the Add Connection label or the plus sign on the upper right in the extension](./media/ch2/database7.png)

1. Use the following values for the Create Connection dialog boxes:

    * Use “localhost” as the server name, then press Enter.
        ![A picture of using localhost as the server name](./media/ch2/database8.png)

    * Use “devDB” as the database name, then press Enter.
        ![A picture of using devDB as the database name](./media/ch2/database9.png)

    * In the Authentication Type dialog box, select “SQL Login“.
        ![A picture of using SQL Login as as the Authentication Type](./media/ch2/database10.png)

    * Here is where it is best to refer back to the command “sqlcmd config connection-strings” to find the username and password. Run it again at the terminal to get the values if needed.

        In the User name (SQL Login) dialog box, enter the user from the connect strings. It should be vscode, then press Enter.
        ![A picture of entering vscode as the database user](./media/ch2/database11.png)

        and provide the password from the connect strings in the Password (SQL Login) dialog box, then press Enter.
        ![A picture of entering the password for the database user](./media/ch2/database12.png)

    * Select “Yes” so that the password is saved (encrypted) on the connection profile
        ![A picture of selecting Yes so that the password is saved on the connection profile](./media/ch2/database13.png)

    * Provide the profile name of "Local Database" in the last dialog box for this step. Press Enter to finish the connection profile process.
        ![A picture of using Local Database as the connection profile name](./media/ch2/database14.png)

    * After pressing Enter and the connection profile is verified, a warning box will appear on the lower right of the screen. This warning is indicating that due to new security features within the database, you need to enable the self-signed certificate.
        Click the Enable Trust Server Certificate green button to continue.

        ![A picture of clicking the Enable Trust Server Certificate green button to continue](./media/ch2/database15.png)

    * There is now a connection to this local database running in docker in the code space you can use for development.

        ![A picture of code spaces indicating a successful connection](./media/ch2/database16.png)

### Create two tables and a stored procedure

1. Back in the Database Projects extension, right click the project name (devDB) and select **Add Table**

    ![A picture of right clicking the project name and selecting Add Table](./media/ch2/database17.png)

1. In the New Table name box on the top of VS Code, enter **person** as the table name. Then press Enter.

    ![A picture of entering person as the new table name](./media/ch2/database18.png)

1. We now have a simple create table script (person.sql) with a single column in our Database Project.

    ![A picture of the new person.sql script and the script contents](./media/ch2/database19.png)

1. To speed things along, we can use some pre-created code for the person table. Replace the code with the following:

    ```SQL
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[person] (
        [person_id]        INT IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([person_id] ASC),
        [person_name]      NVARCHAR (200)      NOT NULL,
        [person_email]     NVARCHAR (200)      NOT NULL,
        [pet_preference]   NVARCHAR (100)      NOT NULL
    );
    ```

    and **save the file**.

    ![A picture of the copy and pasted code into the person.sql script](./media/ch2/database20.png)

1. Create another table by **right clicking** the project name again and select **Add Table**.

    ![A picture of right clicking the project name and selecting Add Table](./media/ch2/database21.png)

1. In the New Table name box on the top of the code space, enter **address** as the table name. Then press Enter.

    ![A picture of entering address as the new table name](./media/ch2/database22.png)

1. Replace the code in the editor with the following code:

    ```SQL
    CREATE TABLE [dbo].[address] (
        [address_id]  INT            IDENTITY (1, 1) NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ([address_id] ASC),
        [person_id] INT            NOT NULL,
        [address]     NVARCHAR (200) NOT NULL,
        CONSTRAINT [FK_address_person] FOREIGN KEY ([person_id]) REFERENCES [dbo].[person] ([person_id])
    );
    ```

    and **save the file**.

    ![A picture of the copy and pasted code into the address.sql script](./media/ch2/database23.png)

1. Now that we have the two tables for the workshop, we can create a simple stored procedure. Right click on the project and select **Add Stored Procedure**.

    ![A picture of right clicking the project name and selecting Add Stored Procedure](./media/ch2/database24.png)

1. Name the new stored procedure get_person_by_pet and press enter

    ![A picture of entering get_person_by_pet as the new stored procedure name](./media/ch2/database25.png)

1. Replace the sample code with the following:

    ```SQL
    CREATE PROCEDURE dbo.get_person_by_pet
        @pet nvarchar(100)
    AS
    BEGIN
        select *
        from dbo.person
        where pet_preference = iif(NULLIF(@pet, '') IS NOT NULL,@pet,pet_preference);
    END;
    GO
    ```

    and **save the file**.

    ![A picture of the copy and pasted code into the get_person_by_pet.sql script](./media/ch2/database26.png)

### Publish to the local database

1. To publish the database code to the local database, **right click** on the project and select **Publish**.

    ![A picture of right clicking the project name and selecting Publish](./media/ch2/database27.png)

1. Select "Publish to an existing Azure SQL logical server" on the first step

    ![A picture of selecting Publish to an existing Azure SQL logical server in the publish database modal flow](./media/ch2/database28.png)

1. Next, select "Don't use profile"

    ![A picture of selecting Don't use profile in the publish database modal flow](./media/ch2/database29.png)

1. Choose the **Local Database** connection you created previously for the connection profile step

    ![A picture of selecting the Local Database connection in the publish database modal flow](./media/ch2/database30.png)

1. Choose **devDB** as the database

    ![A picture of selecting the database named devDB in the publish database modal flow](./media/ch2/database31.png)

1. And finally, for the action, choose **Publish**.

    ![A picture of selecting Publish in the publish database modal flow](./media/ch2/database32.png)

1. Once the dacpac is published into the database,

    ![A picture of the dacpac being published to the database successfully](./media/ch2/database33.png)

    you can go to the SQL Server Connection extension, reload the database objects by right clicking it and selecting refresh,

    ![A picture of reloading the database objects by right clicking it and selecting refresh in the SQL Server extension](./media/ch2/database34.png)

     then open the Tables and Programmability folders to see the deployed objects.

    ![A picture of the Tables and Programmability folders to and the deployed objects](./media/ch2/database35.png)

### Work with the database objects

1. While still on the **SQL Server Connections extension**, right click the database profile name, Local Database, and select **New Query**. This will bring up a new query sheet.

    ![A picture of right clicking the database profile name and selecting New Query](./media/ch2/database36.png)

1. Run the following code in the query sheet:

    ```SQL
    insert into dbo.person(person_name, person_email, pet_preference) values('Bill','bill@computer.com','Dogs');
    insert into dbo.person(person_name, person_email, pet_preference) values('Frank', 'frank@computer.com','Cats');
    insert into dbo.person(person_name, person_email, pet_preference) values('Riley', 'Riley@computer.com','Cats');
    select * from person
    insert into address (person_id, address) values (1, 'Lincoln, MA');
    insert into address (person_id, address) values (2, 'Baltimore, MD');
    select p.person_name, a.address
    from person p, address a
    where p.person_id = a.person_id;
    go
    ```

1. You can also test out the stored procedure with the following code:

    ```SQL
    exec dbo.get_person_by_pet 'Dogs';
    ```
