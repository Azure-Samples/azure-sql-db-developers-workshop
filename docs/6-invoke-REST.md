## REST Endpoint Invocation

Azure SQL Database REST Endpoint Invocation provides the ability to call REST endpoints from other Azure services such as OpenAI, communications, Azure Functions, PowerBI and more. Common use cases for developers to use REST Endpoint Invocation are:

* Ability to push business logic out of the database and into Azure Functions
* Pull/push data to/from external sources (including Azure Blob Storage) for ETL or derived data stores
* Participate in event based architectures with Azure Event Hub or Kafka

REST Endpoint Invocation can be called in an Azure SQL Database using the sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint stored procedure. The following exercises and examples will guide you through calling various Azure Services and seeing how you can integrate REST into your applications and database development implementations.

## Call an Azure Function with REST Endpoint Invocation

In the first example, a sample Azure Function has been created to be used. The function takes in a JSON payload with a name and responds with that name and an additional JSON element of location that is static. This example illustrates how REST Endpoint Invocation can POST a JSON payload to an endpoint and recieve JSON in return. By default, REST Endpoint Invocation expects a JSON payload in the response but this can be overridden to be XML or text.

The pre-created function is as follows:

```C#
#r "Newtonsoft.Json"

using System.Net;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Primitives;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using System.Text;

public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run(HttpRequest req, ILogger log)
{
    log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

    string name = req.Query["name"];

    string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
    dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
    name = name ?? data?.name ?? "Jet Jaguar";

    var myObj = new {name = $"{name}", location = "Earth"};
    var jsonToReturn = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(myObj);
    return new HttpResponseMessage(HttpStatusCode.OK) {
        Content = new StringContent(jsonToReturn, Encoding.UTF8, "application/json")
    };
}
```

1. Start in the **SQL Server Connections extension** and right click the database profile name,** Azure Database**, and select **New Query**. This will bring up a new query sheet.

    ![A picture of right clicking the Azure Database profile name and selecting New Query](./media/ch6/rest2.png)

1. In the empty query sheet, enter the following SQL code:

    ```SQL
    DECLARE @ret INT, @response NVARCHAR(MAX);
    
    EXEC @ret = sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint
      @url = N'https://vslivedemofunction.azurewebsites.net/api/HttpTrigger',
      @payload = N'{"name":"test"}',
      @method = N'POST',
      @response = @response OUTPUT;
    
    SELECT @ret AS ReturnCode, @response AS Response;
    ```

    This T-SQL code calls the REST Endpoint Invocation stored procedure (sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint) and passes it the following values:

    * **ret**: The **return value** of the REST call. It will be 0 if the call is a success (status 200), or the status code if not successful. If the call to the endpoint cannot by done, it will throw an exception.
    * **url**: This is the URL endpoint of the REST service we want to use
    * **payload**: The JSON payload we are POSTing into the service endpoint. Here is contains a single attribute name with a value of test.
    * **method**: This is the HTTP method we are calling. It can be GET, POST, PATCH, PUT or DELETE. By default, if you do not pass this value it will use POST.
    * **response**: The REST endpoint's response to the call.

    Not used in this call:

    * **headers**: These are name and value pairs that represent meta-data for a request.  Headers can contain information for content type of the request, authentication and authorization, character sets and even cache control.
    * **credentials**: Indicates which **DATABASE SCOPED CREDENTIAL** object is used to inject authentication info in the HTTPS request. These are placed in the header of the request.
    * **timeout**: Time in seconds allowed for the HTTPS call to run. The default value 30 and accepted values are 1 through 230.

1. To execute the code, **left click the green arrow** on the top right of the query sheet.

    ![A picture of left clicking the green arrow on the top right of the query sheet to execute the T-SQL code](./media/ch6/rest3.png)

1. The result will appear in a new editor tab just to the right of the one that was used to execute the T-SQL code.

    ![A picture of the result appearing in a new editor tab just to the right of the one that was used to execute the T-SQL code](./media/ch6/rest4.png)

1. Click on the response text in the Results table

    ![A picture of clicking on the response text in the Results table](./media/ch6/rest5.png)

1. A new editor sheet will open with the results of the REST call

    ![A picture of the JSON returned by the function](./media/ch6/rest6.png)

    with a response similar to this JSON

    ```JSON
    {
        "response": {
            "status": {
                "http": {
                    "code": 200,
                    "description": "OK"
                }
            },
            "headers": {
                "Date": "Fri, 23 Jun 2023 22:20:08 GMT",
                "Content-Length": "34",
                "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=utf-8"
            }
        },
        "result": {
            "name": "test",
            "location": "Earth"
        }
    }
    ```

1. The name payload that was POSTed to the endpoint was returned in the result as expected. Experiment with the function by sending no payload or enter your name into the JSON payload.

    ```SQL
      @payload = N'{"name":"Sea Bass"}'
    ```

## Using Azure OpenAI Service and REST Endpoint Invocation

Azure OpenAI Service provides REST API access to OpenAI's powerful language models including ChatGPT, Codex and Embeddings model series. These new services can be accessed through REST APIs, Python SDK, or our web-based interface in the Azure OpenAI Studio. GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models from OpenAI are prompt-based; the user interacts with the model by entering a text prompt, to which the model responds with a text completion. The following examples will use the chat service REST APIs.

The scenario is as follows: using the data we have in the person table, we will ask ChatGPT to provide us some marketing material for switching a pet preference. If a person indicated they like cats, the example will prompt ChatGPT to create ad copy from a marketing executive on why they should love dogs. If they indicated dogs, this will provide copy for loving cats. The example will provide the prompt with Cues and Supporting Content to help guide the response to what was asked.  Cues act as the "jumpstart" for the output of the model, helping to direct the model to the desired output. Supporting content is information that the model can utilize to influence the output in some way such as the current date, the name of the user, and user preferences.

Additional Best Practices from the documentation:

* **Be Specific**. Leave as little to interpretation as possible. Restrict the operational space.
* **Be Descriptive**. Use analogies.
* **Double Down**. Sometimes you may need to repeat yourself to the model. Give instructions before and after your primary content, use an instruction and a cue, etc.
* **Order Matters**. The order in which you present information to the model may impact the output. Whether you put instructions before your content (“summarize the following…”) or after (“summarize the above…”) can make a difference in output. Even the order of few-shot examples can matter. This is referred to as recency bias.
* **Give the model an "out"**. It can sometimes be helpful to give the model an alternative path if it is unable to complete the assigned task. For example, when asking a question over a piece of text you might include something like "respond with ‘not found’ if the answer is not present". This can help the model avoid generating false responses.

### What prompt text will be sent

1. The chat REST API is expecting some text for the prompt so ChatGPT knows how to respond. The following T-SQL code will dynamically create this prompt based on the person_id we supply it. Looking at the adcopy variable, this is used to dynamically create the prompt text by using the person's name and pet perference.

    ```SQL
    set @adcopy =
    (select 'You are an experienced marketing expert named Don Chase Katz. Generate 200 letters of ad copy to '
    + person_name + 
    ' to convince them to love ' + 
    case when pet_preference = 'Cats' then 'Dogs' 
         when pet_preference = 'Dogs' then 'Cats' 
    end
    from dbo.person
    where person_id = 1);
    ```

    The resulting prompt is the following for person_id 1, which is Bill whom has a pet preference of Dogs:

    ```quote
    "You are an experienced marketing expert named Don Chase Katz. Generate 200 letters of ad copy to Bill to convince them to love Cats"
    ```

    The next section of the code builds the REST call to Azure OpenAI using REST Endpoint Invocation. 

    ```SQL
    declare @url nvarchar(4000) = N'https://vslive-openai.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/chattycathy/chat/completions?api-version=2023-06-01-preview';
    declare @headers nvarchar(102) = N'{"api-key":"589ca34db9d0458db6a67137716e6258"}'
    declare @payload nvarchar(max) = N'{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"'+(@adcopy)+'"}]}'
    declare @ret int, @response nvarchar(max);
    
    exec @ret = sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint 
    	@url = @url,
    	@method = 'POST',
    	@headers = @headers,
    	@payload = @payload,
        @timeout = 230,
    	@response = @response output;
    	
    select @ret as ReturnCode, @response as Response;
    ```

    The important point to note here is that the headers are being used to pass an API Key for authentication.

### Sending the prompt text with REST Endpoint Invocation

1. Open a new query sheet

    ![A picture of right clicking the Azure Database profile name and selecting New Query](./media/ch6/rest2.png)

    and paste the following T-SQL code into a new query editor sheet in the codespace.

    ```SQL
    declare @adcopy VARCHAR(500);
    
    set @adcopy =
    (select 'You are an experienced marketing expert named Don Chase Katz. Generate 200 letters of ad copy to '
    + person_name + 
    ' to convince them to love ' + 
    case when pet_preference = 'Cats' then 'Dogs' 
         when pet_preference = 'Dogs' then 'Cats' 
    end
    from dbo.person
    where person_id = 1);
    
    declare @url nvarchar(4000) = N'https://vslive-openai.openai.azure.com/openai/deployments/chattycathy/chat/completions?api-version=2023-06-01-preview';
    declare @headers nvarchar(102) = N'{"api-key":"589ca34db9d0458db6a67137716e6258"}'
    declare @payload nvarchar(max) = N'{"messages":[{"role":"system","content":"'+(@adcopy)+'"}]}'
    declare @ret int, @response nvarchar(max);
    
    exec @ret = sp_invoke_external_rest_endpoint 
    	@url = @url,
    	@method = 'POST',
    	@headers = @headers,
    	@payload = @payload,
        @timeout = 230,
    	@response = @response output;
    	
    select @ret as ReturnCode, @response as Response;
    ```

1. Once the code is in the codespace query editor sheet, run it with the green run arrow in the upper right.

    ![A picture of left clicking the green arrow on the top right of the query sheet to execute the T-SQL code](./media/ch6/rest7.png)

    The response message will be similar to the following:

    ```JSON
    {
        "response": {
            "status": {
                "http": {

    As a marketing expert, I know the power of persuasion. So allow me to persuade you about the wonders of cats.
    First off, cats are independent creatures. They don’t require constant attention, like dogs do. This makes them the perfect companion for those leading busy lives. Plus, they’re great for introverted people who prefer the company of a quiet, yet loyal animal.
    Secondly, cats are incredibly clean animals. They groom themselves, eliminating the need for constant baths. Plus, they’re pretty skilled at using the litter box, meaning minimal mess for you.
    Thirdly, cats are incredible hunters. They possess incredible instincts, which allow them to hunt mice and other rodents that might invade your home. This makes them the perfect pest control alternative to toxic chemicals.
    Fourthly, cats are amazing stress-relievers. Petting a cat has been shown to release endorphins in your brain, which produces feelings of calmness and relaxation. Plus, the sound of a purring cat has a soothing effect on one's psyche.
    Fifthly, cats are low-maintenance. Unlike dogs, they don’t require you to take them on walks. They are happy to lounge in the sun, in your lap, or on their own.
    Finally, cats are adorable creatures. Their playful antics, cute meows, and affectionate nature will make your heart melt.
    In conclusion, Bill, I urge you to give cats a chance. They are low-maintenance, great hunters, calming, and beautiful creatures. They will fill your life with love and companionship. 
    Sincerely,
    Don Chase Katz"
