# Deploy the database objects to the Azure SQL Database

The next section of the workshop will be using an Azure SQL Database. To move our development environment into the cloud, all that is needed to be done is use SQL Database Projects and point it at an Azure SQL Database. The deploy feature will then create the objects in the selected cloud database just as it did with the local SQL Server database in the code space.

### Create a connection profile

1. Using the extensions panel, select the **SQL Server connections extension**

    ![A picture of selecting the SQL Server connection extension in code spaces](./media/ch5/deploy1.png)

    and create a new connection by clicking the plus sign on the upper right in the extension.

    ![A picture of creating a new connection by clicking the plus sign on the upper right in the extension](./media/ch5/deploy2.png)

1. Use the following values for the Create Connection dialog boxes:

    * Use “vslivedemos2023.database.windows.net” as the server name, then press Enter.
        ![A picture of using localhost as the server name](./media/ch5/deploy3.png)

    * Use “vslivedemodb**X**” as the database name, **replacing X with the number of the database you were given**, then press Enter.
        ![A picture of using vslivedemodbX as the database name](./media/ch5/deploy4.png)

    * In the Authentication Type dialog box, select “SQL Login“.
        ![A picture of using SQL Login as as the Authentication Type](./media/ch5/deploy5.png)

    * Refer back to the credentials supplied for you for the demo database to find the username and password. It would be in the format of “vslivedemodb**X**” as the user name, **replacing X with the number of the database user you were given**

        In the User name (SQL Login) dialog box, enter the user from the supplied credentials, then press Enter.
        ![A picture of entering vslivedemodbX as the database user](./media/ch5/deploy6.png)

        and provide the password from the supplied credentials in the Password (SQL Login) dialog box, then press Enter.
        ![A picture of entering the password for the database user](./media/ch5/deploy7.png)

    * Select “Yes” so that the password is saved (encrypted) on the connection profile
        ![A picture of selecting Yes so that the password is saved on the connection profile](./media/ch5/deploy8.png)

    * Provide the profile name of "Azure Database" in the last dialog box for this step. Press Enter to finish the connection profile process.
        ![A picture of using Azure Database as the connection profile name](./media/ch5/deploy9.png)

    * After pressing Enter and the connection profile is verified, a warning box **may** appear on the lower right of the screen. This warning is indicating that due to new security features within the database, you need to enable the self-signed certificate.
        Click the Enable Trust Server Certificate green button to continue.

        ![A picture of clicking the Enable Trust Server Certificate green button to continue](./media/ch5/deploy10.png)

    * There is now a connection to the Azure SQL Database running in the cloud in the code space you can use for deployment and further development.

### Create a post deployment script

1. Return to the Database Projects extension, 

    ![A picture of right clicking the database project extension](./media/ch5/deploy12.png)


    and right click the project name (devDB) and select **Add Post-Deployment Script**

    ![A picture of right clicking the project name and selecting Add Post-Deployment Script](./media/ch5/deploy13.png)

1. Keep the default name of **Script.PostDeployment1** and press enter/return.

    ![A picture of keeping the default name of Script.PostDeployment1 for the Post-Deployment Script](./media/ch5/deploy14.png)


1. Replace the files contents with the following SQL statements

    ```SQL
    insert into dbo.person(person_name, person_email, pet_preference) values('Bill','bill@computer.com','Dogs');
    insert into dbo.person(person_name, person_email, pet_preference) values('Frank', 'frank@computer.com','Cats');
    insert into dbo.person(person_name, person_email, pet_preference) values('Riley', 'Riley@computer.com','Cats');
    insert into address (person_id, address) values (1, 'Lincoln, MA');
    insert into address (person_id, address) values (2, 'Baltimore, MD');
    GO
    ```

    and **SAVE** the file.

### Publish to an Azure SQL Database

1. To publish the database code to the local database, **right click** on the project and select **Publish**.

    ![A picture of right clicking the project name and selecting Publish](./media/ch5/deploy16.png)

1. Select "Publish to an existing Azure SQL logical server" on the first step

    ![A picture of selecting Publish to an existing Azure SQL logical server in the publish database modal flow](./media/ch7/deploy17.png)

1. Next, select "Don't use profile"

    ![A picture of selecting Don't use profile in the publish database modal flow](./media/ch5/deploy18.png)

1. Choose the **Azure Database** connection you created previously for the connection profile step

    ![A picture of selecting the Azure Database connection in the publish database modal flow](./media/ch5/deploy19.png)

1. Choose **vslivedemodbX** as the database, where X is the number you were given when creating the connection profile.

    ![A picture of selecting the database named devDB in the publish database modal flow](./media/ch5/deploy20.png)

1. And finally, for the action, choose **Publish**.

    ![A picture of selecting Publish in the publish database modal flow](./media/ch5/deploy21.png)

1. Once the dacpac is published into the database,

    ![A picture of the dacpac being published to the database successfully](./media/ch5/deploy22.png)

    you can go to the SQL Server Connection extension, reload the database objects by right clicking it and selecting refresh,

    ![A picture of reloading the database objects by right clicking it and selecting refresh in the SQL Server extension](./media/ch5/deploy23.png)

     then open the Tables and Programmability folders to see the deployed objects.

    ![A picture of the Tables and Programmability folders to and the deployed objects](./media/ch5/deploy24.png)

### Verify the deployed database objects and data

1. While still on the **SQL Server Connections extension**, right click the database profile name,** Azure Database**, and select **New Query**. This will bring up a new query sheet.

    ![A picture of right clicking the Azure Database profile name and selecting New Query](./media/ch5/deploy25.png)

1. Run the following code in the query sheet:

    ```SQL
    select * from person;
    select p.person_name, a.address
    from person p, address a
    where p.person_id = a.person_id;
    go
    ```

1. You can also test out the stored procedure with the following code:

    ```SQL
    exec dbo.get_person_by_pet 'Dogs';
    ```
